            If any provision of the Terms of Use is found by a court or other binding authority to be invalid, you agree that every attempt shall be made to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in that provision, and the remaining provisions contained in the Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect.
          </p>
          <p class="node-title">18. Dispute resolution</p>
          <p class="text">
            You and Company agree to resolve any disputes between us in accordance with this Section 18. If you believe that Company has not adhered to the Terms of Use or you have any dispute with Company, please contact Company using the contact information provided below. We will do our best to address your concerns and we will attempt to resolve any disputes with you amicably.
          </p>
          <p class="text">Except as provided herein, you and Company agree that we will resolve any disputes between us that we cannot resolve as provided above through binding and final arbitration instead of through court proceedings. All such controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes arising between you and Company relating to the Websites, the Services or this Terms of Use (each a “Claim”) shall be submitted for binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“HKIAC”). If HKIAC is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an available alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) and the rules of such provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration. The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator’s decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs, documents, or other evidence submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies.</p>
          <p class="text">
            For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, the HKIAC (or ADR Provider, if applicable), you and Company must abide by the following rules: (a) the arbitration will be conducted solely based on written submissions; and (b) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA (or ADR Provider, if applicable) rules, and the hearing (if any) will be held in the state of Delaware.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Company will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator’s fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and Company also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court. In addition, you and Company retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions, and any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with this Terms of Use, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in this Terms of Use.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            Neither you nor Company may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. Claims may not be arbitrated on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or Company’s individual Claims. The arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            If any provision of this Section 18 is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section 18 shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver of any provision of this Section 18 will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Terms of Use. This Section 18 will survive the termination of this Terms of Use or your relationship with Company.
          </p>
          <p class="text">
            THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION OR TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM AND THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES OR THE RULES OF AN ADR PROVIDER.

          <p class="node-title">19. Applicable law and venue</p>
          <p class="text">
            This Terms of Use and the resolution of any dispute related to this Terms of Use will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of Hong Kong, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the law of a different state.
