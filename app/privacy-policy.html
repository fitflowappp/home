            IMPORTANT – TRANSFER OF DATA AND PERSONAL INFORMATION We may store data about you, including personal information, on servers located and operated in a country or several countries (“Data Storage Country or Countries”) other than where you reside.

If you create a user account by logging into the SNP via the Services, you are using the personal information you have already provided to the SNP (such as your “real” name, e-mail address, age and other information you make available via the SNP) to create your account on our Services. Accordingly, if you use Facebook Connect to join the Services, you are allowing us to access the personal information in your Facebook account pursuant to Facebook’s terms and conditions governing your use of the Services via Facebook.
